## Description

This single-player card game allows a user to pass some pleasant moments playing the classic card game Uno against some basic programmed logic. At the start of the game, the user and the computer opponent are both dealt 7 cards. The computer cards are rendered face down, and the user cards are rendered face up. The game begins with the user turn. Play a card by clicking it, and if you are not able, then draw a card bit clicking the draw stack in the middle. If you are still unable to play, press the end turn button. Wild cards trigger a pop-up selector where the user can choose a card color. A "call uno" button is enabled when the user is down to two cards. If the user has not pressed the "call uno" button by the start of the computer's turn, then they are dealt two cards.
